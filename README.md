# ClipMixer
This clip mixer is a Unity editor extension that allows you to mix animation clips non-destructively.

# Feature
## OverrideMixer
This means that you can nondestructively add override clips to an animation clip, and when you change the override clips, you can simply press the Mix button to adapt them to your production.
These overrides can be defined and specified by tagging the animation clip.

The tag treats each letter from the first letter of the animation clip's name to "_" as a tag, and
No more than one tag may be attached to an overriding clip.
### How to use 
"Create > OverrideMixersetting" to generate a configuration file.
Select the folder containing each animation clip from the Select button and press the Clip Mix button.

Only one so far, sorry! I may add more, depending on the mood of the author.
